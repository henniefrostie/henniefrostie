## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @henniefrostie, otherwise known as Hennie
I am a web designer and full stack developer based in the East Midlands, UK. I recently graduated from a foundation degree, and 
previously worked as a self-employed web developer creating websites using Wordpress.

In my spare time I love organising unnessecary things, and have recently I've been obsessed with using [notion](https://www.notion.so/).
